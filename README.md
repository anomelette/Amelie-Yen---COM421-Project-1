## Self-Critique:

Overall I feel pretty happy with my work here. There aren't any errors in the W3C validator. I also feel like visually it's pretty aesthetic and is easy to navigate. The colors I chose are very simple and have good contrast. I especially like how my navigation highlights in blue when you hover over it. If I had more time, I would change my navigation bar to be uniformly sized on each page as it bothers me that it changes when you switch pages. I would also add more images/icons and a back/forward button onto the page to make it even more user friendly and easier to navigate.
